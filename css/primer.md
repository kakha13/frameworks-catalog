**Primer** was created for GitHub by GitHub. We love it so much, we chose to open-source it to allow the community to design and build their own projects with Primer.

*Primer CSS*: https://primer.style/css/
Our goal is to create a system that enables us to build consistent user experiences with ease, yet with enough flexibility to support the broad spectrum of GitHub websites. This goal is embedded in our design and code decisions. Our approach to CSS is influenced by Object Oriented CSS principles, functional CSS, and BEM architecture.
